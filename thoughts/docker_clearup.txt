name: docker, ways to clean up after yourself

Docker provides a single command that will clean up any resources — images, containers, volumes, and networks — that are dangling (not associated with a container):
`docker system prune`

To additionally remove any stopped containers and all unused images (not just dangling images), add the -a flag to the command:
`docker system prune -a`

Remove all images
`docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)`

Remove all exited containers
`docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)`
