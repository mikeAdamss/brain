Open the network port
PostgreSQL accepts remote connections on port 5432. Follow these steps to add a firewall rule that enables traffic on this port.

In the Cloud Console, navigate to the Create a firewall rule page.

Create a firewall rule

In the Network field, leave the network as default.

In the Name field, enter:

postgres-tutorial

In the Direction of traffic field, create a rule as Ingress and another rule as Egress.

In Source IP Ranges, enter the same IP address you used in hba.conf. This is the IP address of your local computer. Remember to include the /32 suffix, for example: 1.2.3.4/32.

In Allowed protocols and ports, enter:

tcp:5432

Click Create.
