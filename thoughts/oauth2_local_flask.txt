- create credentials
- oauth client ID

Select the Web application option at the top. You can provide a name for the client in the Name field as well. 
The name you provide will be displayed to users when they are consenting to your application acting on their behalf.

You’ll be running your web application locally for now, so you can set the Authorized JavaScript origins to https://127.0.0.1:5000 
and Authorized redirect URIs to https://127.0.0.1:5000/login/callback. This will allow your local Flask application to communicate with Google.

Finally, hit Create and take note of the client ID and client secret. You’ll need both later.
